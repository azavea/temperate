      <p class="paragraph-intro">Temperate gives you access to more data, identifies major risks to your region, assists you in anticipating the impacts of climate change on your community, and lets you come away with a robust first draft of an adaptation plan. It goes beyond the presentation of generic information by tailoring the projected risk factors to your specific city or town.</p><p>Unlike other applications that simply give you the data and expect you to know how to translate that into a plan, as a registered Temperate member, you will have access to experts to help you find the right information, understand the impacts of climate change on your community, and create an adaptation plan for you to share with other stakeholders.</p>
